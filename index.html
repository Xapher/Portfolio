				<section id="aboutText">
					My name is Bryan and i'm a software engineer with knowledge based on website development and design with mostly self taught general programming with C#/Java ranging from beginner to advanced skills. I Have gone to college for UI/UX Development as well as frontend/backend development. My main language to use is C# for my game development hobby in my free time, However I use Java for simple Socket based networking to create my own virtual screen assistant. I like to experiment with and create different technologies and algorithms, I've experimented with: 
					<ul>
						<li>Compression</li>
						<li>Encryption</li>
						<li>3D terrain generation based off of an image</li>
						<li>3D terrain generation based off of voronoi algorithms</li>
						<li>My own voronoi algorithm</li>
						<li>Terrain erosion</li>
						<li>Procedural Textures</li>
						<li>Socket networking</li>
					</ul>

					My passion is in recreating algorithms or complete projects if they do not meet my requirements or needs. I mostly recreate games as a hobby, the reason being they either do not have good game mechanics or the networking does not work within my group of collegues, however, I have modified some existing open source projects to fit my need or fix/update them to newer versions depending on the use case.
