			<p>Thank you for stopping by! The main page is just a quick summary of what i'm currently working on. To view more projects please go to the top menu.</p>
			<section>
				<p>I'm currently working on a few different things. The biggest being a VR game I plan to release on Steam. However, I'm making smaller projects to create the technology needed to use for that game. The one I'm focusing on is recreating and expanding my terrain generator to take advantage of Compute Shaders.</p>

				<h1>About the game:</h1>
				<p>Without giving too much away, it will be an environment building game that develops as you brew coffee as a barista. It will have dynamic weather, and modifiable large width terrains. Possibly even dynamic floating terrain.</p>
				<p>I'm currently working on the terrain generation part of the game as that will be the biggest part. As well as I have already made a start to the brewing mechanics. Which will be going into more complicated coffee systems like blooming, coffee strength, roast type, flavor profile, etc.</p>
				<p>Progress: Working on it when not working on other projects.</p>

				<h1>About the Terrain Generator:</h1>
				<p>A Planned unity plugin that will allow you to create massive terrain that looks good, as realistic as possible using different types of erosions and weathering systems.</p>
				<p>I'm currently re-writing the generator that I had before. It was using C# script using the cpu, which started out fine. However, adding more developments to it severely degraded the generating time. So I'm currently converting it to use compute shaders to take advantage of mass parallelization. The CPU Generator was able to run pretty good erosion and I was starting to work on a biome system based on the erosion based off of humidity from the water.</p>
				<p>Progress: re-wrote to generate height and currently working on realistic erosion.</p>

				<h1>Current 3D print</h1>
				<p>I'm Remodeling some video game models from the game Destiny 2. These are secret projects for now and there will be no pictures until they are received as gifts.</p>
				<p>Model 1: Remeshed, working on 3D print functionality/electronics.</p>
				<p>Model 2: Currently Remeshing.</p>
